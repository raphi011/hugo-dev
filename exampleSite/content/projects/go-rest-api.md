A minimal, production-ready REST API template using only Go's standard library. Demonstrates routing with Go 1.22's enhanced `ServeMux`, structured logging with `slog`, and idiomatic error handling.

## Stack

- Go 1.22+ standard library
- `net/http` with method-based routing
- `log/slog` for structured logging
- `httptest` for integration tests
